  <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
  <p>As you become a more experienced programmer, you eventually start growing out of your old bad coding habits. You know the ones I'm talking about:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Inconsistent brackets</li>
   <li>Bad variable naming</li>
   <li>Not deleting allocated memory (only in C/C++)</li>
   <li>Mixing up syntax</li>
   <li>Scoping rules</li>
  </ul>
  No matter what it is, it is great to break out of these bad coding habits. Now of course for me, this didn't just happen overnight. It took years of coding and understanding to realize that breaking out of these habits will not only benefit you, but also anyone else that may read your code. While I will not claim that I am a coding guru of any kind, I think I can leave you all with some helpful tips to become better programmers.
  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <h3>Organization</h3>
  <p>When professors or instructors tell you that your code needs to be organize, THEY ARE NOT PLAYING! It is extremely important that your code is well organized. One of the ways that I learned how to organize my code is by just sticking to one style of coding. What I mean by that is keeping the way you write lines of code as consistent as possible. If you're someone who likes to initialize variables as they are created, make sure you do that as often as needed. Another thing to keep consistent is the way you create brackets. Some people like myself make new lines for each bracket, while some like to have the first one after the function name, and one right at the end. Whichever one you choose, make sure you don't switch it up.</p>
 <h3>Files</h3>
 <p>If you are making a project and it involves multiple files, then it is best to name your files appropriately. If there are certain files that help do a specific task, then make sure that it is named in a way that you and another person can easily identify.<p>
 <h3>Directories</h3>
 <p>Similar to naming files, make sure that your directories (or folders) are named appropriately. In my opinion, the name of your directories is more important than the files. Especially when you are accessing files in a terminal where names will be a very important factor.</p>
 <h2>Tricks</h2>
 <h3>Variale Naming</h3>
 <p>It is smart to name your variables in a way that is easy for you and others to be able to understand. For example, if you made a simple program that calculated the sum of numbers, then the integer that you print out should probably be called something like sum, total, or some other easy to understand name. You also should name them based on their specific function in the code for organization.</p>
 <h3>IDE Choice</h3>
 <p>While the IDE that one uses to make their code doesn't typically matter since it is a matter of preference, some have better advantages than others. If you are someone who likes writing code in a UNIX based program, it might be harder to catch silly mistakes until you try compiling the code. I recommend the CLion IDE because it is very helpful in telling you the little mistakes that you have been made. It will also tell you when variables that you have in your code are useless, or repeated at some other point of the code. While this is only a recommendation, the choice is yours.</p>
