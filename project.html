  <h2>Making a Project</h2>
  <p>One thing that I would recommend to any aspiring programmer is that you should always be working on some sort of project if you have some free time. This is not only because it can make you a better programmer, but also because if your project is good enough (such as an app that is published on the app store), then that can be used on your resume to help you get a job. Employers don't always look at just internships, side projects can help boost your resume. Here are some side projects that you can do for fun.</p>
  <h3>My Ideas</h3>
  <p>Now I wouldn't recommend using these projects in your resume, but these are just meant for fun and little challenges.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Program that orders name from an Excel file</li>
   <li>Hangman game with GUI</li>
   <li>Client-server program such as a Slack Clone</li>
   <li>Twitter Bot</li>
   <li>Application with a database that can be accessed</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Online Ideas</h3>
  <p>I believe that if you want to find projects that can be used on a resume, online is the best source. This article from <a href="https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/programming-projects-resume/">purelyfunctional</a> has some great examples that I would highly recommend.</p>
