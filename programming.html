  <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
  <p>Throughout one's programming career, they will have to choose from multiple different programming languages. This is because certain programming languages offer many different abilities. While you may be able to get a program finished in one language, another language may allow the user to do the same thing, but much more efficiently. Not only that, but some languages are easier to understand. I know personally when I started college, we learned Java as it was a very beginner-friendly language to learn. Once you are able to master that, you can move on to much more complex languages like C and C++ where new ways of programming are introduced. However no matter what language you are using, it is important to use that programming language to its full advantages.</p>
  <h2>The Different Types of Languages</h2>
  <h3>Java</h3>
  <p>The Java programming language is often one of the first languages that students at University learn. This is because Java is very easily to learn as there is not as much maintenance when using it. One big reason is because of Java's garbage collected. In other languages like C, the user must allocate memory for certain objects such as arrays. In Java, the user does not need to worry about that, as Java does the allocating and deallocating for you. Oftentimes when people think of Java, they think of Object-Oriented Programming. Java happens to be one of it not the best language for this programming paradigm. The use of objects in Java is without a doubt the most important tool when using this programming language. You will not be able to use Java if you are not creating objects.</p>
 <h3>Python</h3>
 <p>Python is another programming language that beginner programer use. If you grew up on languages like C or Java, then using Python may be weird for you. This is because this language is not har-coded. What I mean by that is that you are not required to declare what kind of variable type a variable may be. A variable named num could be an integer by simply assigning it an integer value. Besides that, Python is also very versatile because it has a wide variety of libraries that can be used on it.</p>
 <h3>C/C++</h3>
 <p>Without a doubt, one of the hardest languages that you will ever learn in C/C++. The reason that they are grouped together is because the two languages are very similar, and the way that it is coded is nearly identical. C correlates more with machine code, and C++ is a derivative of C that is more readable for those who have used other languages. To get back to the reason why this languages is kind of hard to use, it is because this language involves the use of pointers, and the need to allocate memory. These two things can be very annoying for those who are not well equipped to handle them. With tons of practice, you can do a lot of great things with C/C++.</p>
 <h3>Other Languages</h3>
 <p>Now there are a TON of other programming languages out there, and some of them are better than others. However, different languages accomplish different things. HTML and CSS are used for web development, Javascript can be used for web applications, Bash scripting is very useful with terminal commands, and so much more. You should explore the different programming languages out there and find ones that you would like to learn.</p>
