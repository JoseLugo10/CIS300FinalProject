  <h2>Welcome to jelprogramming.com!</h2>
  <p>This site created by Jose Lugo was designed to help my fellow future computer programmers. I envisioned a website that I wish I had that could not only teach me valuable programming skills, but also provide me tips the knowledge on how to become a better/more efficient programmer. At jelprogramming.com, we provide numerous computer science based topics that are sure to teach you something new!</p>
  <h3>What To Expect</h3>
  <p>At jelprogramming.com, we offer many guides and tutorials on various programming topics. Some range from very basic beginner topics while others are more complex and will take more time to understand. No matter what, we have what you are looking for. Some examples of what you may see throughout the multiple pages of topics are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Quicksort Algorithm</li>
   <li>Linked Lists</li>
   <li>Programming Neatness</li>
   <li>Understanding C/C++</li>
   <li>Hash Tables</li>
  </ul>
  and so much more!
  <h3>Why Should I Use This Site?</h3>
  <p>I believe that you should choose this website for your programming knowledge because I understand what it feels like to not understand anything. I've grind throughout my college life and know what it feels like to be clueless on everything related to programming. I'm providing a gateway for people to feel welcomed on this site, no matter the skill level.</p>
 <h3>Where Should I Start?</h3>
 <p>While I won't say that there is an all time best programming language to start off with, here's a little video that shows the most used programming languages since 2011. It might give you an idea of where the industry is heading and what you might want to start learning.</p>
